Business problem
=========================

There are more than 1,500 coffee shops in Toronto, and the industry is all about the location.  The business problem is to identify which neighbourhoods in Toronto have a high number of parks and green spaces, but low number of cafes â€“ leaving a potential gap in the market.

Data 
=========================

The project will be developed using open data from Wikipedia on Toronto neighbourhoods, and FourSquare API.
